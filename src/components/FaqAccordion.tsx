        question: "What exactly does your service do?",
        answer: (
          <>
            We help you convert your corporate well-being amount into a <b>freedom voucher</b> that lets you buy <b>anything from anywhere</b> ‚Äî Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa, and more. You're no longer stuck with a fixed list of products.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: "What is a freedom voucher?",
        answer: (
          <>
            It's a digital voucher you get from us equal to your well-being allowance, which you can use to <b>purchase any product or service you want</b> ‚Äî from any platform.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: "How is this better than my company's well-being portal?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Your company's portal usually restricts your options to a few products or vendors. With our voucher, <b>you get full freedom of choice</b> ‚Äî no limitations, no forced purchases.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: "Is this legal and tax-compliant?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Yes. We are a <b>GST-registered vendor</b>, and we provide a <b>GST invoice</b> for every voucher purchased, making it fully compliant with Indian tax laws.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to tell my company about this?",
        answer: (
          <>
            No. You're using your <b>own well-being amount</b> to buy a service from us. You'll get an invoice which you can submit to your employer for reimbursement.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: "Are you overcharging us? Is this even legal?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Not at all. We never charge above MRP. Prices may vary like on any platform ‚Äî just like buying something for ‚Çπ10,000 today and seeing it drop to ‚Çπ9,000 tomorrow. It's completely legal and based on service value, not overpricing.
